Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the response type for successful requests (200 status)
2. Then define error types based on the error responses
3. Create the method that:
   - Takes linkIds as input
   - Constructs the query parameters
   - Makes the DELETE request
   - Handles both success and error responses
4. Add proper typing for all inputs and outputs

Here's the implementation:

```typescript:src/client.ts
// ... existing ExampleClient class ...

  /**
   * DELETE /links/bulk
   * @tags Links
   * @summary Bulk delete links
   * @description Bulk delete up to 100 links for the authenticated workspace.
   */
  async deleteMany(linkIds: string[]): Promise<{ deletedCount: number }> {
    try {
      const response = await this.fetch({
        method: 'DELETE',
        path: '/links/bulk',
        query: { linkIds: linkIds.join(',') }
      });

      if (!response.ok) {
        const errorData = await response.json();
        throw new ExampleError(errorData.error.message, {
          status: response.status,
          data: errorData
        });
      }

      return response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof ExampleError) {
        throw error;
      }
      throw new ExampleError('Unknown error occurred', {
        status: 500,
        data: error
      });
    }
  }

// ... rest of existing code ...

// Add these type definitions at the end of the file
type BulkDeleteLinksSuccessResponse = {
  deletedCount: number;
};

type ErrorResponse = {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    doc_url?: string;
  };
};

type BadRequestError = ErrorResponse;
type UnauthorizedError = ErrorResponse;
type ForbiddenError = ErrorResponse;
type NotFoundError = ErrorResponse;
type ConflictError = ErrorResponse;
type InviteExpiredError = ErrorResponse;
type UnprocessableEntityError = ErrorResponse;
type RateLimitExceededError = ErrorResponse;
type InternalServerError = ErrorResponse;
```
