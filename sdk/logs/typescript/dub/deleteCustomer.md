Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the response type for successful deletion (200 response)
2. Then we need to define error response types based on the OpenAPI schema
3. Create the delete method in the ExampleClient class
4. Add proper error handling for different status codes
5. Use the existing fetch method to make the API call

Here's the implementation:

```typescript:example-client.ts
// ... existing ExampleClient class ...

// DELETE /customers/{id} - Customers
/**
 * Delete a customer from a workspace.
 * @param id The unique identifier of the customer in Dub.
 * @returns Promise<DeleteCustomerResponse>
 */
async deleteCustomer(id: string): Promise<DeleteCustomerResponse> {
  try {
    const response = await this.fetch({
      method: 'DELETE',
      path: `/customers/${id}`,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new ExampleError(errorData.error.message, {
        status: response.status,
        data: errorData,
      });
    }

    return response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ExampleError) {
      throw error;
    }
    throw new ExampleError('An unexpected error occurred', {
      status: 500,
      data: error,
    });
  }
}

// ... existing ExampleError class and other code ...

// Response and Error Types
interface DeleteCustomerResponse {
  id: string;
}

interface DubError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  doc_url?: string;
}

interface DubErrorResponse {
  error: DubError;
}

// Error type aliases for specific error responses
type BadRequestError = DubErrorResponse;
type UnauthorizedError = DubErrorResponse;
type ForbiddenError = DubErrorResponse;
type NotFoundError = DubErrorResponse;
type ConflictError = DubErrorResponse;
type InviteExpiredError = DubErrorResponse;
type UnprocessableEntityError = DubErrorResponse;
type RateLimitExceededError = DubErrorResponse;
type InternalServerError = DubErrorResponse;
```
