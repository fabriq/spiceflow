Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the types for:
   - Request body (CreateTagRequest)
   - Response type (TagSchema)
   - Error responses (using the existing ExampleError)

2. The method needs to:
   - Accept the request parameters
   - Make a POST request to /tags
   - Handle successful responses (201)
   - Handle error responses using the existing ExampleError class

3. We'll add the method to the ExampleClient class since it already has the fetch infrastructure we need.

Here's the implementation:

```typescript:exampleClient.ts
export class ExampleClient {
  // ... existing code ...

  /**
   * POST /tags
   * Create a new tag for the authenticated workspace.
   * Tags: Tags
   */
  async createTag(body: {
    name: string;
