---
To implement the `DELETE /domains/{slug}` route in the `ExampleClient` class, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define the Method**: We will create a method named `deleteDomain` that takes a `slug` parameter.
2. **Add Route Information**: We will include a comment above the method to specify the route path, method, and tags.
3. **Type Definitions**: We will define the input and output types for the method. The input will be a string for the `slug`, and the output will be a promise that resolves to a response type.
4. **Error Handling**: We will handle potential errors by checking the response status and throwing an `ExampleError` if the response indicates an error.
5. **Use Fetch**: The method will utilize the existing `fetch` method to make the API call.

Here’s the code snippet to add to the `ExampleClient` class in `client.ts`:

```typescript:client.ts
  // DELETE /domains/{slug}
  // Deletes a domain from a workspace. It cannot be undone.
  async deleteDomain(slug: string): Promise<{ slug: string } | ExampleError> {
    const response = await this.fetch<{ slug: string }>({
      method: 'DELETE',
      path: `/domains/${encodeURIComponent(slug)}`,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new ExampleError(errorData.error.message, { status: response.status, data: errorData });
    }

    return response.json();
  }
```

### Global Scope Declarations
At the end of the snippet, we will declare the types and functions required to make the method work, if they are not already defined in the `components.ts` file. However, since the `components.ts` file is not editable and we are using the existing types, we do not need to add any new global declarations here. 

This method will now allow the `ExampleClient` to delete a domain by its slug, handling errors appropriately and returning the expected response type.
