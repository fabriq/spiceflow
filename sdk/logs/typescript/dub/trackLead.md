Let me break down the implementation step by step:

1. We need to add a new method to track leads
2. The method will use POST /track/lead endpoint
3. We'll need to define the request and response types based on the OpenAPI schema
4. The method should handle error responses using the existing ExampleError class
5. We'll use the existing fetch method from the ExampleClient class
6. The request body has required fields (clickId, eventName) and optional fields
7. The response has a specific structure with click and customer objects

Here's the implementation:

```typescript:client.ts
// ... existing code ...

export class ExampleClient {
  // ... existing code ...

  /**
   * POST /track/lead
   * @tags Track
   * @summary Track a lead
   * @description Track a lead for a short link.
   */
  async trackLead(
    request: {
      clickId: string
      eventName: string
      externalId?: string
      customerId?: string | null
      customerName?: string | null
      customerEmail?: string | null
      customerAvatar?: string | null
      metadata?: Record<string, any> | null
    }
  ): Promise<{
    click: { id: string }
    customer: {
      name: string | null
      email: string | null
      avatar: string | null
      externalId: string | null
    }
  }> {
    const response = await this.fetch({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/track/lead',
      body: request
    })

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => null)
      throw new ExampleError(
        errorData?.error?.message || 'Failed to track lead',
        {
          status: response.status,
          data: errorData
        }
      )
    }

    return response.json()
  }
}

// ... existing code ...
```
