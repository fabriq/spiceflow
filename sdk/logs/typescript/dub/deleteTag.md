Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. We need to create a new method in the ExampleClient class for deleting a tag
2. The method will take a single parameter - the tag ID (string)
3. It will use the existing fetch method to make a DELETE request
4. We need to define the response type for successful deletion
5. We'll handle error responses using the existing ExampleError class
6. The method should return the deleted tag ID on success

Here's the implementation:

```typescript:exampleClient.ts
export class ExampleClient {
  // ... existing code ...

  /**
   * DELETE /tags/{id}
   * Tags: Tags
   * Delete a tag from the workspace. All existing links will still work, but they will no longer be associated with this tag.
   */
  async deleteTag(id: string): Promise<{ id: string }> {
    const response = await this.fetch({
      method: 'DELETE',
      path: `/tags/${id}`,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
      throw new ExampleError(errorData.error?.message || 'Failed to delete tag', {
        status: response.status,
        data: errorData,
      });
    }

    return response.json();
  }
}

// Type declarations
interface DeleteTagResponse {
  id: string;
}

interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    doc_url?: string;
  };
}
```
