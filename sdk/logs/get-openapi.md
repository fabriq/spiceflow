The route `GET /openapi` is already implemented in the provided SDK code. However, I'll provide a clean and standalone implementation for this route, ensuring it adheres to the requirements and is fully typed.

```typescript
/**
 * GET /openapi
 * Method: GET
 * Tags: None
 * Description: Fetches the OpenAPI schema.
 */
async getOpenApiSchema(): Promise<any> {
  const path = '/openapi';
  const method = 'GET';

  try {
    const response = await this.fetch({
      method,
      path,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
      throw new ExampleError('Failed to fetch OpenAPI schema', {
        status: response.status,
        data: errorData,
      });
    }

    return response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ExampleError) {
      throw error;
    }
    throw new ExampleError('An unexpected error occurred', {
      status: 500,
      data: error,
    });
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Route Path and Method**: The route is `GET /openapi`, and the method is `GET`.
2. **Error Handling**: The method includes error handling to catch and throw custom `ExampleError` instances if the request fails.
3. **Response Handling**: The response is parsed as JSON and returned. If the response is not OK (status code >= 400), an error is thrown with the status code and any error data.
4. **Type Safety**: The method is typed to return `Promise<any>` since the OpenAPI schema can be any JSON object. If the schema structure is known, you can replace `any` with a more specific type.

This implementation is consistent with the existing SDK code and can be used in both Node.js and browser environments.
