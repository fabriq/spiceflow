Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the TagSchema type based on the OpenAPI schema
2. Then we'll create the list_tags method in the ExampleClientAsync class
3. The method will:
   - Make a GET request to /tags
   - Handle the response and parse the JSON
   - Handle potential errors using the ExampleError class
   - Return a list of TagSchema objects

Here's the implementation:

```python
# ... existing imports ...
from typing import List, Literal, TypedDict

# Define TagSchema type based on OpenAPI schema
class TagSchema(TypedDict):
    id: str
    name: str
    color: Literal["red", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple", "pink", "brown"]

class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # GET /tags - Retrieve a list of tags
    # Tags: Tags
    async def list_tags(self) -> List[TagSchema]:
        response = await self.fetch("GET", "/tags")
        
        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.json()
        
        error_data = await response.json()
        raise ExampleError(
            error=error_data.get("error", {}).get("message", "Unknown error"),
            status=response.status,
            data=error_data
        )
```

The implementation:
1. Adds TagSchema type definition using TypedDict with Literal for the color enum
2. Creates list_tags method with proper type hints
3. Uses existing fetch method to make the request
4. Handles successful response (200) by returning parsed JSON
5. Handles errors by raising ExampleError with error details
6. Includes proper docstring with route information

The method is fully async/await compatible and uses type hints for better IDE support. It handles both successful responses and error cases appropriately.
