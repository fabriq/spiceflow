---
Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the response type for successful deletion (200 response)
2. Then we need to define error types based on the error responses
3. We'll create a method that handles the DELETE request with proper type hints
4. The method will use the existing fetch method from the client
5. We'll add proper error handling for different status codes

Here's the implementation:

```python
# ... existing imports ...
from typing import TypedDict

# Response types
class DeleteCustomerResponse(TypedDict):
    id: str

# Error types
class ErrorDetail(TypedDict):
    code: str
    message: str
    doc_url: Optional[str]

class APIError(TypedDict):
    error: ErrorDetail

class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # DELETE /customers/{id} - Delete a customer
    async def delete_customer(self, id: str) -> DeleteCustomerResponse:
        """
        DELETE /customers/{id}
        Method: DELETE
        Tags: Customers
        
        Deletes a customer from a workspace.
        
        Args:
            id: The unique identifier of the customer in Dub.
            
        Returns:
            DeleteCustomerResponse: Response containing the deleted customer ID
            
        Raises:
            ExampleError: If the API returns an error status code
        """
        response = await self.fetch(
            method="DELETE",
            path=f"/customers/{id}"
        )
        
        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.json()
            
        error_data = await response.json()
        raise ExampleError(
            error=error_data.get("error", {}).get("message", "Unknown error"),
            status=response.status,
            data=error_data
        )
```

The implementation includes:
- A typed response structure for successful deletion
- Proper error type definitions
- A well-documented async method with type hints
- Error handling that raises ExampleError with detailed information
- Integration with the existing fetch method
- Proper URL path construction with the customer ID parameter

The method follows Python's async/await pattern and includes comprehensive type hints for better IDE support and code clarity.
