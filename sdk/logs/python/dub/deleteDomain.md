Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the response type for successful deletion (200 response)
2. We'll need to define error types based on the error responses
3. The method will need to handle the path parameter (slug)
4. We'll use the existing fetch method to make the request
5. We'll add proper error handling for the various status codes

Here's the implementation:

```python
# ... existing imports ...
from typing import TypedDict

# Define response types
class DeleteDomainResponse(TypedDict):
    slug: str

# Define error types
class ErrorDetail(TypedDict):
    code: str
    message: str
    doc_url: Optional[str]

class APIError(TypedDict):
    error: ErrorDetail

class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # DELETE /domains/{slug} - Delete a domain
    # Tags: Domains
    async def delete_domain(self, slug: str) -> DeleteDomainResponse:
        path = f"/domains/{slug}"
        response = await self.fetch("DELETE", path)
        
        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.json()
        
        error_data = await response.json()
        error_message = error_data.get("error", {}).get("message", "Unknown error")
        
        if response.status == 400:
            raise ExampleError(f"Bad Request: {error_message}", 400, error_data)
        elif response.status == 401:
            raise ExampleError(f"Unauthorized: {error_message}", 401, error_data)
        elif response.status == 403:
            raise ExampleError(f"Forbidden: {error_message}", 403, error_data)
        elif response.status == 404:
            raise ExampleError(f"Not Found: {error_message}", 404, error_data)
        elif response.status == 409:
            raise ExampleError(f"Conflict: {error_message}", 409, error_data)
        elif response.status == 410:
            raise ExampleError(f"Invite Expired: {error_message}", 410, error_data)
        elif response.status == 422:
            raise ExampleError(f"Unprocessable Entity: {error_message}", 422, error_data)
        elif response.status == 429:
