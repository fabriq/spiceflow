Let's implement the `/stream` endpoint method step by step:

1. The route is a GET request with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming
2. It returns a JSON object with `count` and `timestamp` properties
3. We'll use the existing `stream_sse_response` helper function
4. We need to handle the response as an async generator
5. The response schema should be typed for better IDE support

Here's the implementation:

```python:example_client_async.py
class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # GET /stream
    # Method: GET
    # Tags: example-tag
    async def get_stream(self) -> AsyncGenerator[Dict[str, float], None]:
        """Stream Endpoint
        
        Returns an async generator when used in the SDK
        
        - Uses server sent events
        - But also has a response schema
        """
        response = await self.fetch("GET", "/stream")
        
        if response.status != 200:
            raise ExampleError(
                f"Unexpected status code: {response.status}",
                status=response.status,
                data=await response.text(),
            )
            
        async for event in stream_sse_response(response):
            yield event

# ... existing types and functions remain unchanged ...
```

The implementation:
1. Adds a new async method `get_stream` that returns an async generator
2. Uses the existing `fetch` method to make the request
3. Handles error cases by raising `ExampleError`
4. Uses the existing `stream_sse_response` helper to process the SSE stream
5. The return type is properly typed as `AsyncGenerator[Dict[str, float], None]` since the response schema includes numeric fields
6. Includes the route documentation as a method comment with path, method, and tags
