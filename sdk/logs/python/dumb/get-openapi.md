Let's implement the GET /openapi route. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. This is a simple GET request with no parameters or request body
2. It returns a response with content type */* (any type)
3. We'll need to handle the response as raw data since the schema is unspecified
4. We should add proper error handling for the response
5. The method should be async and return the raw response data

Here's the implementation:

```python:example_client_async.py
class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # GET /openapi
    # Method: GET
    # Tags: None
    async def get_openapi(self) -> Any:
        """Fetch the OpenAPI specification"""
        response = await self.fetch("GET", "/openapi")
        
        if response.status != 200:
            raise ExampleError(
                f"Request failed with status code: {response.status}",
                status=response.status,
                data=await response.text(),
            )
            
        return await response.json()
```

The implementation:
1. Adds a new async method `get_openapi` to the ExampleClientAsync class
2. Uses the existing fetch method to make the request
3. Handles error cases by raising ExampleError with the status code and response text
4. Returns the parsed JSON response for successful requests
5. Includes a docstring that describes the method's purpose

No additional type declarations are needed as we're using existing types from the previous code. The method returns Any since the response schema is unspecified in the OpenAPI document.
