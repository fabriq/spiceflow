Let's implement the GET / route method step by step:

1. The route is a simple GET request with no parameters or request body
2. It returns a 200 response with no specific schema
3. We'll use the existing `fetch` method from the client
4. We'll add proper type hints and error handling
5. The method will be async and return the raw response

Here's the implementation:

```python:example_client_async.py
class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # GET / - Route path: "/", Method: "GET", Tags: []
    async def take(self) -> Any:
        """Make a GET request to the root endpoint"""
        response = await self.fetch("GET", "/")
        
        if response.status != 200:
            raise ExampleError(
                f"Request failed with status {response.status}",
                status=response.status,
                data=await response.text(),
            )
            
        try:
            return await response.json()
        except aiohttp.ContentTypeError:
            return await response.text()
```

The implementation:
1. Uses the existing `fetch` method to make the request
2. Checks for non-200 status codes and raises an ExampleError
3. Attempts to parse JSON response, falls back to text if not JSON
4. Returns the parsed response data
5. Includes proper type hints and docstring

No additional types or functions need to be declared as we're using existing ones from the previous code.
