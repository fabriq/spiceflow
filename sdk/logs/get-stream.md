The `/stream` route is already implemented in the provided SDK code. However, I can provide a more detailed and standalone implementation of the `stream` method, including comments and type definitions.

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

```typescript
/**
 * GET /stream
 * Method: GET
 * Tags: example-tag
 * 
 * Returns an async generator for server-sent events (SSE) with a response schema.
 * 
 * @returns {AsyncGenerator<{ count: number; timestamp: number }>} An async generator yielding objects with `count` and `timestamp` properties.
 */
async *stream(): AsyncGenerator<{ count: number; timestamp: number }> {
    try {
        const response = await this.fetch({
            method: 'GET',
            path: '/stream',
            headers: {
                Accept: 'text/event-stream',
            },
        });

        if (!response.ok) {
            const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({}));
            throw new ExampleError('Failed to fetch stream', {
                status: response.status,
                data: errorData,
            });
        }

        for await (const event of streamSSEResponse(response)) {
            if (event.event === 'data') {
                yield event.data;
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        if (error instanceof ExampleError) {
            throw error;
        }
        throw new ExampleError('Network error', { status: 500 });
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Method Signature**:
   - The method is an `async generator` (`async *`), which allows it to yield values asynchronously.
   - It returns an `AsyncGenerator` that yields objects with `count` and `timestamp` properties, as defined by the OpenAPI schema.

2. **Request Handling**:
   - The `fetch` method is used to make a GET request to the `/stream` endpoint.
   - The `Accept` header is set to `text/event-stream` to indicate that the client expects an SSE response.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the response is not OK (status code >= 400), an error is thrown with the status code and any error data returned by the server.
   - Network errors are caught and rethrown as `ExampleError` with a 500 status code.

4. **Streaming Response**:
   - The `streamSSEResponse` function is used to parse the SSE response and yield events.
   - Only events with the `event` type `data` are yielded, as these contain the actual data.

5. **Type Safety**:
   - The method is fully typed, with the return type explicitly defined as `AsyncGenerator<{ count: number; timestamp: number }>`.
   - This ensures that the data yielded by the generator matches the schema defined in the OpenAPI specification.

### Usage Example:

```typescript
const client = new ExampleClient({ baseUrl: 'https://api.com', token: 'your-jwt-token' });

(async () => {
    try {
        for await (const event of client.stream()) {
            console.log('Received event:', event);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error streaming data:', error);
    }
})();
```

This implementation ensures that the SDK method is fully typed, handles errors gracefully, and works in both Node.js and browser environments.
