Here is the TypeScript SDK method for the `POST /vault.v1.VaultService/Encrypt` route. This method will use `fetch` for making API calls, handle request/response serialization, and include error handling. It will also be fully typed for both inputs and outputs.

```typescript
/**
 * POST /vault.v1.VaultService/Encrypt
 * Method: POST
 * Tags: vault
 * 
 * Encrypts the provided data using the specified keyring.
 * 
 * @param body - The request body containing the data to encrypt and the keyring to use.
 * @returns The encrypted data and the key ID used for encryption.
 * @throws {ExampleError} If the request fails.
 */
export async function encrypt(
  body: V1EncryptRequestBody
): Promise<V1EncryptResponseBody> {
  const response = await this.fetch({
    method: 'POST',
    path: '/vault.v1.VaultService/Encrypt',
    body,
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const errorData = await response.json();
    throw new ExampleError('Failed to encrypt data', {
      status: response.status,
      data: errorData,
    });
  }

  return response.json();
}

// Type Definitions
interface V1EncryptRequestBody {
  $schema?: string;
  data: string;
  keyring: string;
}

interface V1EncryptResponseBody {
  $schema?: string;
  encrypted: string;
  keyId: string;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `encrypt`**:
   - This function takes a `V1EncryptRequestBody` object as input, which includes the `data` to encrypt and the `keyring` to use.
   - It makes a `POST` request to the `/vault.v1.VaultService/Encrypt` endpoint using the `fetch` method.
   - If the response is not OK (i.e., status code is not in the 200-299 range), it throws an `ExampleError` with the status code and error data.
   - If the request is successful, it returns the parsed JSON response, which is of type `V1EncryptResponseBody`.

2. **Type Definitions**:
   - `V1EncryptRequestBody`: Defines the structure of the request body, including optional `$schema`, required `data`, and `keyring`.
   - `V1EncryptResponseBody`: Defines the structure of the response body, including optional `$schema`, required `encrypted` data, and `keyId`.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If the request fails, the function throws an `ExampleError` with the status code and error data, allowing the caller to handle the error appropriately.

This method is designed to be used in both Node.js and browser environments, as it relies on the `fetch` API, which is available in both contexts.
