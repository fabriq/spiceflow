Let me break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the response type for successful deletion (200 response)
2. Then we'll create the method with proper type hints and error handling
3. The method will use the existing fetch utility
4. We'll handle the query parameter serialization
5. Error handling will use the existing ExampleError class

Here's the implementation:

```python
# ... existing imports ...
from typing import List, TypedDict

class BulkDeleteLinksResponse(TypedDict):
    deletedCount: float

# ... existing ExampleClientAsync class ...

    # DELETE /links/bulk - Tags: Links
    async def delete_many_links(self, link_ids: List[str]) -> BulkDeleteLinksResponse:
        """
        Bulk delete up to 100 links for the authenticated workspace.
        
        Args:
            link_ids: List of link IDs to delete (max 100)
            
        Returns:
            BulkDeleteLinksResponse with deletedCount
            
        Raises:
            ExampleError: If the request fails with any 4xx/5xx status code
        """
        if len(link_ids) > 100:
            raise ValueError("Maximum of 100 link IDs allowed")

        response = await self.fetch(
            method="DELETE",
            path="/links/bulk",
            query={"linkIds": ",".join(link_ids)}
        )

        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.json()
        else:
            error_data = await response.json()
            raise ExampleError(
                error=error_data.get("error", {}).get("message", "Unknown error"),
                status=response.status,
                data=error_data
            )
```

The implementation includes:
- A typed response class for the 200 response
- Input validation for the maximum number of link IDs
- Proper query parameter serialization
