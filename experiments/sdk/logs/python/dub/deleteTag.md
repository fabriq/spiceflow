Let's break down the implementation step by step:

1. First, we need to define the response type for successful deletion (200 response)
2. Then we need to define error types based on the error responses
3. We'll create a method that handles the DELETE request with proper type hints
4. The method will handle path parameters and return the appropriate response type
5. We'll add error handling for the various HTTP status codes

Here's the implementation:

```python
# ... existing imports ...
from typing import TypedDict

# Response Types
class DeleteTagResponse(TypedDict):
    id: str

# Error Types
class ErrorDetail(TypedDict):
    code: str
    message: str
    doc_url: Optional[str]

class APIError(TypedDict):
    error: ErrorDetail

class BadRequest(APIError): pass
class Unauthorized(APIError): pass
class Forbidden(APIError): pass
class NotFound(APIError): pass
class Conflict(APIError): pass
class InviteExpired(APIError): pass
class UnprocessableEntity(APIError): pass
class RateLimitExceeded(APIError): pass
class InternalServerError(APIError): pass

class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # DELETE /tags/{id} - Tags
    async def delete_tag(self, id: str) -> DeleteTagResponse:
        """Delete a tag from the workspace.

        response = await self.fetch(
            method="DELETE",
            path=f"/tags/{id}"
        )
        
        if response.status == 200:
            return await response.json()
        elif response.status == 400:
            raise ExampleError("Bad Request", 400, await response.json())
        elif response.status == 401:
            raise ExampleError("Unauthorized", 401, await response.json())

        elif response.status == 409:
            raise ExampleError("Conflict", 409, await response.json())
        elif response.status == 410:
