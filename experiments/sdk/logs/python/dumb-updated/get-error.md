Let's analyze what needs to be done:

1. The `/error` route was previously implemented but has been deleted from the OpenAPI schema
2. We need to remove the corresponding method from the SDK
3. The method to remove is `get_error()` in the `ExampleClientAsync` class
4. No other changes are needed since this is a removal rather than an addition

Here's the code to remove:

```python:previousSdkCode
class ExampleClientAsync:
    # ... existing code ...

    # Remove this method
    # GET /error
    # Tags: example-tag
    async def get_error(self) -> Any:
        """Error Endpoint
        Always throws an error for testing error handling
        """
        response = await self.fetch("GET", "/error")
        
        if response.status != 200:
            try:
                error_data = await response.json()
                raise ExampleError(
                    error=error_data.get("message", "Unknown error"),
                    status=response.status,
                    data=error_data
                )
            except (json.JSONDecodeError, aiohttp.ContentTypeError):
                raise ExampleError(
                    error=f"Request failed with status {response.status}",
                    status=response.status
                )
        
        try:
            return await response.json()
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, aiohttp.ContentTypeError):
            return await response.text()

    # ... rest of the class ...
```

The rest of the SDK code can remain unchanged. This removal aligns the SDK with the current OpenAPI specification by removing a route that no longer exists in the API.
