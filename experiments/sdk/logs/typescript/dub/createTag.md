To implement the `POST /tags` route in the `ExampleClient` class, we will create a new method called `createTag`. This method will handle the request to create a new tag, including the necessary input parameters, response handling, and error management.

### Steps to Implement the Method:
1. **Define the Input Type**: The method will accept an object with optional `color` and required `name` properties.
2. **Define the Output Type**: The method will return a `Promise` that resolves to a `Tag` object.
3. **Add Error Handling**: The method will handle various HTTP response statuses and throw an `ExampleError` for non-2xx responses.
4. **Comment the Method**: Include a comment above the method indicating the route path, method, and tags.
5. **Use the Existing Fetch Method**: Leverage the existing `fetch` method in the class to make the API call.

Here’s the code snippet to add to the `ExampleClient` class in `./client.ts`:

```typescript:client.ts
  // POST /tags
  // Create a new tag
  // Tags
  async createTag({
    name,
    color,
  }: {
    name: string;
    color?: "red" | "yellow" | "green" | "blue" | "purple" | "pink" | "brown";
  }): Promise<Tag> {
    const response = await this.fetch<Tag>({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/tags',
      body: { name, color },
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new ExampleError(errorData.error.message, { status: response.status, data: errorData });
    }

    return response.json() as Promise<Tag>;
  }
```

### Summary of Changes:
- Added the `createTag` method to handle the `POST /tags` route.
- The method is fully typed for both inputs and outputs, with optional fields where required.
- Error handling is implemented to throw an `ExampleError` for non-2xx responses.
