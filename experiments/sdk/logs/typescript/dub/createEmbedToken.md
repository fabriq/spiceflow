---
To implement the `POST /tokens/embed` route in the `ExampleClient` class, we will create a new method called `createEmbedToken`. This method will handle the request and response serialization, error handling, and will be fully typed for both inputs and outputs.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Define Input and Output Types**: We will define the input type for the request body and the output type for the response based on the OpenAPI schema.
2. **Add the Method**: The method will use the existing `fetch` method to make the API call.
3. **Handle Errors**: We will handle potential errors by checking the response status and throwing an appropriate error if necessary.
4. **Add Comments**: We will include comments above the method to indicate the route path, method, and tags.

### Code Snippet:
Here’s the code snippet to be added to the `client.ts` file:

```typescript:client.ts
  // POST /tokens/embed
  // Creates a new embed token
  async createEmbedToken(
    body: { linkId: string }
  ): Promise<{
    publicToken: string;
    expires: string;
  }> {
    const response = await this.fetch<{ linkId: string }, { publicToken: string; expires: string }>({
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/tokens/embed',
      body,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new ExampleError(errorData.error.message, { status: response.status, data: errorData });
    }

    return response.json();
  }
```

### Global Scope Declarations:
At the end of the snippet, we will ensure that the necessary types and functions are declared globally if they are not already defined in the `components.ts` file. However, since the `components.ts` file is not editable, we assume the types are already available for use. 

This method will allow users to create a new embed token by providing a `linkId`, and it will return the `publicToken` and its expiration time. The error handling ensures that any issues with the request are properly communicated.
