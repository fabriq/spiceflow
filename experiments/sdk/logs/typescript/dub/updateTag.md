To implement the `PATCH /tags/{id}` route in the `ExampleClient` class, we will create a new method called `updateTag`. This method will:

1. **Define the route path, method, and tags** in a comment above the method.
2. **Use the `fetch` method** to make the API call.
3. **Handle request serialization** by converting the input parameters into the appropriate JSON format.
4. **Handle response serialization** by returning the expected output type.
5. **Include error handling** for various response statuses.
6. **Use the types defined in `./components.ts`** for both input and output types.

The input for this method will include the `id` of the tag to update and an optional request body containing the `name` and `color` of the tag. The output will be the updated `Tag` object.

Here’s the code snippet to add to the `ExampleClient` class:

```typescript:client.ts
  // PATCH /tags/{id} - Update a tag
  async updateTag(
    id: string,
    body?: {
      name?: string;
      color?: Color;
    }
  ): Promise<Tag> {
    const response = await this.fetch<Tag>({
      method: 'PATCH',
      path: `/tags/${id}`,
      body,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new ExampleError(errorData.error.message, { status: response.status, data: errorData });
    }

    return response.json() as Promise<Tag>;
  }
```

### Global Scope Declarations
At the end of the snippet, we ensure that the necessary types and functions are declared globally, which are already provided in the `components.ts` file. The `Color` type is used directly from the imported types. 

This method will allow users to update a tag by providing the tag's ID and the new values for the tag's properties. The error handling ensures that any issues with the request are properly communicated.
